There is serious concern that the continued increase in drug development costs is unsustainable and will lead to further increases in already exorbitant drug prices, highlighting the need for a new paradigm for therapeutic discovery. To meet these challenges, we develop tools for therapeutic design to accelerate discovery and enable personalized medicine. Our work integrates molecular and systems modeling, machine learning, and global optimization to develop multi-scale models of biomolecular systems, and then leverages these models for the design of novel therapeutics.

Computational methods have emerged as a promising approach for peptide-based vaccine design, where models are used to identify which fragments of the pathogen (epitopes) would serve as a representative element to elicit a robust immune response. Epitope prediction involves predicting the outcomes of antigen processing and presentation given the genetic sequence of a pathogen. The challenges of epitope prediction are compounded further due to the existence of uncertainty caused by genetic variability across pathogen variants and individual to individual. As a result of this uncertainty, epitope prediction involves finding peptide fragments that would be consistently generated by the antigen processing of all (or at least most) pathogen variants and recognized as foreign by the immune systems of all (or at least most) individuals. We are developing a computational framework for identifying peptide epitopes that couples biomolecular structure, machine learning, and probabilistic models to account for the effects of genetic mutations on the interactions between the pathogen and host.
